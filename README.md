# Tuning_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Algorithm_through_Tabu_Search-from_Scratch


This code optimizes PSO through TS. TS is usually used for optimizing discrete space but we saw that it performed well for tuning continueous PSO parameters. We tuned c1, c2 and inertia. We then tested on 4 benchmark functions.
